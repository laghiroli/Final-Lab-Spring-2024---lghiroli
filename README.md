# My program has a few main functionalities. First, it reads the Courses2023.xlsx file to create a Professors.txt file, which list each Professor and the CRNs of courses this professor teaches. Additionally, when given any last name, the codeÂ will find professors with that last name and create a list of all courses taught by this instructor, including CRN number. The code is also able to generate a new course using overloading, and the user can enter information about the subject, coursenumber, section, etc. of the course. Finally, the code is able to read a transcript.xlsx file and locate students grades, and use these grades to calculate a GPA average.
